## Django Translator
This is an automatic translator for django projects... you can update your translations manually later... 
This project still under development please do not utilize with text that is constantly updated cause this may cause 
a rapidly growth on the database and a possible DoS for your backend.. Only use this in text that is directly controlled by 
moderators and trusted people, never for visitants or clients..
